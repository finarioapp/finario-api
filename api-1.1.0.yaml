      # Introduction

      Our set of REST-based APIs enable seamless integration of Finario directly
      into your internal workflows, products and services. The API uses JSON
      over HTTPS to allow you to build applications capable of using or adding
      Finario data in your application, and vice-versa.

      > Please note, API access is available in various editions, please ask 
      your Finario account manager.

      # Developer Portal

      This specification is available both publicly and from within the
      [Developer Portal](https://api-proxy.finario.com/devportal). To be able to
      try out the API endpoints, you will need to have access to the Developer
      Portal. The Developer Portal contains an easy way to generate
      authentication tokens, along with download the Postman collection and
      generated boilerplate code.

      > Contact your Finario account manager to gain access to the
      [Developer Portal](https://api-proxy.finario.com/devportal).

      # OpenAPI 3.0.1

      The Finario API is built and documented using [OpenAPI 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.1.md).
      In addition to standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few vendor extensions to
      improve compatibility with tooling and documentation.

      # CORS

      This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in
      compliance with the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that
      allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a
      wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to
      everyone, including any code on any site.

      # Authentication

      Finario API requires two forms of authentication:
        - OAuth2 (in the `Authorization` header); and
        - Finario API Token (in the `x-api-token` header).

      #### OAuth2

      OAuth2 allows secure authorization in a simple and standard method from
      web, mobile and desktop applications.

        - **Grant Type**: Client credentials
        - **Access Token URL**: `https://api-proxy.finario.com/oauth2/token`
        - **Add auth data to**: Request Headers
        - **Header prefix**: Bearer
          - `--header 'Authorization: Bearer <Token>'`

      #### Finario API Token
        * Visit your **Profile** in the Finario app: `https://<your_host>.finario.com/profile/api_token`.
          - Generate your API Key.
          - Configure the white list of IP addresses that can access your API.
        * Familiarize yourself with our authentication process and the Finario resource names.
        * Begin developing your application.

      Finario API Token Auth Details
        - **Add auth data to**: Request Headers
        - **Parameter name**: x-api-token
          - `--header 'x-api-token: <Finario API Token>'`

          After an investment is approved, Finario can send the investment's
          data to an API endpoint of your choosing.

          #### Set Up

          Setup is performed within the Finario app. An Administrator can set up
          Web Hooks at:

          `https://<your_host>.finario.com/web_hooks`.

          The information required is as follows:

          - Endpoint (the URL Finario will send the investment payload to after approval)
          - API Key (if needed for your endpoint)
          - API Secret (if needed for your endpoint)
          - The conditions that will trigger the payload being sent. These
          conditions will only be matched after an investment has been fully
          approved.

          > You can also send test requests to the endpoint you set up from
          within the Finario app.

        responses:
