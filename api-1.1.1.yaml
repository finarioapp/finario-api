    ## Introduction
    
    Our set of REST-based APIs enable seamless integration of Finario directly into your internal workflows, products and services. The API uses JSON over HTTPS to allow you to build secure applications capable of using or adding Finario data in your application, and vice-versa.
    
    > Please note, API access is available in various editions, so please contact your Finario account manager for more information.

    This API is built and documented using [OpenAPI 3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md). In addition to standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few vendor extensions to improve compatibility with tooling and documentation.
    
    ## Development Workflow
    
    Developing integrations using the Finario API is easy and the workflow relatively straight-forward. You will need to perform the following:
    
    1. Ensure you have a Finario account.
    2. Familiarize yourself with the API **[Endpoints](#tag/Approvals)** and **[Webhooks](#tag/Webhooks)**.
    3. Familiarize yourself with the [headers required](#section/Required-Headers) to be sent with each request. 
    4. Familiarize yourself with [how to authenticate](#section/Authentication) when using the API.
    5. [Generate](#section/Authentication/ApiToken) your API Token.
    6. Start using the API, either in your code or via your tooling of choice.
    
    ### Development & Testing Tools
    
    There are many different tools that can be used for developing and testing APIs. If you're experienced, we'd imagine you've seen them all. If you have your own preference, feel free to use that. If your existing toolchain comes with some form of HTTP client and that's what you're familiar with, feel free to stick with that.
    
    However, for completeness, below we provide some links to tooling that we use and would recommend when building and testing APIs.
    
    You can [import this specification](/api-1.1.1.yaml) into an API testing tool such as **Postman** or **Paw**. You can also use command-line tools such as **curl**, **wget** or **httpie**. By using tools such as Postman or Paw, you will be able to genereate code stubs for a variety of popular languages to speed your development and testing efforts.
    
    - [Postman](https://www.postman.com) | [Paw](https://paw.cloud) | [curl](https://curl.se) | [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) | [httpie](https://httpie.io)

    ## Download the API Spec
    
    **[Download](/api-1.1.1.yaml)** version 1.1.1 of the specification for use in your chosen API development and testing tools.
    
    - For versions 1.0 and earlier, please see this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/finarioapp/api).
    
    ## URLs
    
    The current version of the API is `1.1`. As such the following base URLs are in use (please notice the postfix of the version number to the URL):
    
    | <div style="width:130px">Environment</div> | Base URL |
    | ---------------- | --- |
    | Sandbox    | `https://api-sandbox.finario.com` |
    | Production | `https://api.finario.com` |
    
    ## Required Headers
    
    ### Request
    
    This API requires you to send the following three headers, at a minimum, as part of each HTTP request:
    
    | <div style="width:130px">Header Name</div> | Description |
    | ---------------- | --- |
    | `content-type`   | Must be `application/json`. |
    | `x-api-token`    | As described in the [Authentication](#section/Authentication/ApiToken) section below. |
    | `x-finario-host` | The Finario host name that you use to login to your Finario app. For example, if you login to the Finario app at `example-co.finario.com`, then your `x-finario-host` will be `example-co`. |
    
    ### Response
    
    To receive a valid HTTP response, your API must be able to accept `application/json` as a response media type.
    
    ### CORS
    
    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.
    
    ## Example Request
    
    To show a list of users on your account using the popular `curl` or `httpie` command-line tools:
    
    > Remember to replace the `x-api-token` and `x-finario-host` with appropriate values for your setup:

    ```shell    
    curl --request GET \
      --url https://api-sandbox.finario.com/1.1/users \ 
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-api-token: <your-api-token>' \
      --header 'x-finario-host: <your-finario-instance-name>'
    ```
    
    ```shell
    http https://api-sandbox.finario.com/1.1/users \
      content-type:application/json \
      x-api-token:<your-api-token> \
      x-finario-host:<your-finario-instance-name>
    ```

        ### Generate your API Token
        
        To generate an API Token, follow the steps below:
          
          1. Visit your **Profile** in the Finario app: `https://<your-host>.finario.com/profile`.
          2. Under **Profile Actions** on the left, click **API Token**.
             - If you do not see the item **API Token**, you will need to contact your Finario account manager to gain access. 
          3. Click **Get One** to generate your API Token for use in all API requests.
          4. Configure a white list of IP addresses if you want to add additional security to your Finario API endpoint. This is not required, but here if you want the additional security.

        After an investment is approved, Finario can send the investment's
        data to an API endpoint of your choosing.

        #### Set Up

        Setup is performed within the Finario app. An Administrator can set up
        Web Hooks at:

        `https://<your_host>.finario.com/web_hooks`.

        The information required is as follows:

        - Endpoint (the URL Finario will send the investment payload to after approval)
        - API Key (if needed for your endpoint)
        - API Secret (if needed for your endpoint)
        - The conditions that will trigger the payload being sent. These
        conditions will only be matched after an investment has been fully
        approved.

        > You can also send test requests to the endpoint you set up from
        within the Finario app.
